## Running Instructions

The repository linked above can be run with Java or using a Python file. We recommend a setup with 32 GB of RAM. Make sure to check the right branch is checked out before running by using: 
`git checkout ingy`.

**Python**: We provide a Python 3 script to make running experiments and organize the output files easier. 
**usage**: `python run_experiments.py exp_type [rep] [alg] [set or case study]`
The experiment types `exp_type` available are: base experiment `-b`, vary the number of atoms in the distribution representation with risk neutral DVI `-a`, vary the number of atoms in the distribution representation with risk sensitive DVI `-t`, vary the number of atoms in the slack variable approximation with risk sensitive DVI `-c`, vary the DTMC precision `-e`. 
* The `-r` option selects the distribution representation method: `c51` for categorical and `qr` for quantile representation. 
* The `-s` option selects a case study. Available case studies include:['betting_g', 'ds_treasure', 'drones', 'gridmap_10', 'mud_nails', 'uav_var', 'drones_15', 'gridmap_150_3918'].
* The `-i` option selects risk sensitive or risk neutral DVI: `exp` for risk neutral, `cvar` for risk sensitive. The default value is all. Note that certain experiments can only be run with certain version of DVI.
* The `-x` option selects an appendix string to add to output files

Examples:
* To run risk sensitive and risk neutral DVI with a categorical representation on the Obtacle 10 case study with '_testing' as an appendix to output file names:

    `python run_experiments.py -b -r c51 -s gridmap_10 -x testing`
* To run risk sensitive and risk neutral DVI with a categorical representation on the Obtacle 10 case study, run the vary atoms experiment with risk neutral DVI and the slack approximation experiment:
    
    `python run_experiments.py -b -a -c -r c51 -s gridmap_10`

**Java**: Check the property file to decide which type of DVI to run. Properties including `R(dist)min` runs risk-neutral DVI and properties with `R(cvar)min` will run risk-sensitive DVI. 

The `-prop` option indicates the property number in the `.props` file, the `-distrmethod` option selects the distribution representation method (c51 for categorical and qr for quantile representation). 

The DVI parameters should be updated in the `prism/tests/params_vi.csv` file containing the number of atoms for the distributional representation, vmin and vmax for the representation interval, error for the error threshold to determine convergence, epsilon for the DTMC error, alpha for the alpha CVaR parameter if applicable. 

If using risk-sensitive DVI, the `prism/tests/params_b.csv` file contains the number of atoms, vmin and vmax for the slack variable approximation. 

Examples: 
* Risk-neutral DVI with Betting Game with C51: 
    
    `prism/bin/prism -javastack 80m -javamaxmem 14g prism/tests/betting_game.prism prism/tests/betting_game.props -distrmethod c51 -prop 3 -v -ex -exportstrat stdout -mainlog prism/betting_game_risk_neutral.log`
* Risk-sensitive DVI with Betting Game with C51: 
    
    `prism/bin/prism -javastack 80m -javamaxmem 14g prism/tests/betting_game.prism prism/tests/betting_game.props -distrmethod c51 -prop 2 -v -ex -exportstrat stdout -mainlog prism/betting_game_risk_sensitive.log`
* Risk-neutral DVI with Obstacle 10 with QR:
    
     `prism/bin/prism -javastack 80m -javamaxmem 14g prism/tests/gridmap/gridmap_10_10.prism prism/tests/gridmap/gridmap_10_10.props -distrmethod qr -prop 3 -v -ex -exportstrat stdout -mainlog prism/obstacle_risk_neutral.log`

## Output files

If using the Python script, all the output files for the run will be saved in `prism/tests/experiments/<experiment_name>/` i.e. if running a base experiment for the betting game model, the files will be saved in `prism/tests/experiments/betting_g`. Files with the `<algorithm>` set as 'vi' represent PRISM (non distributional) VI baseline files.
Files:
* Log files: 
    * Base experiment: 
    `<experiment_name>_log_<algorithm>_<representation_type>_<appendix>.log`
    * Vary atoms experiment: 
    `<experiment_name>_log_<algorithm>_<representation_type>_<atoms>_<appendix>.log`
* Trace files: this type of file shows a trajectory sample of the synthesized policy. Start at the initial state and take policy actions until a terminal state is reached. They are of the format: `<experiment_name>_distr_<algorithm>_<representation_type>_<appendix>_trace.csv`
* VI distribution files: these files contain the approximated distribution for the initial state computed during distributional VI. The distribution files save the atom index (r), the associated probability (p) and the atom value (z). They follow the naming format: `<experiment_name>_distr_<algorithm>_<representation_type>_<appendix>.csv` or `<experiment_name>_distr_<algorithm>_<representation_type>_<atoms>_<appendix>.csv`. 
* DTMC distribution files: these files contain the distributions obtained using the forward generation method on the induced DTMC. They save all possible atom values (r) and their associated probability. They follow the naming format: `<experiment_name>_distr_dtmc_<algorithm>_<representation_type>_<appendix>.csv` or `<experiment_name>_distr_dtmc_<algorithm>_<representation_type>_<atoms>_<appendix>.csv`.

## Output visualization

We provide a JupyterLab Python Notebook to visualize results and print distributional metrics: [distr.ipynb](https://github.com/davexparker/prism/blob/ingy/prism/distr.ipynb)

All cells before the Setup section contain the distribution loading and metric computation functions.
Blue distribution graphs show the DTMC distributions, while the green graphs show the approximate DVI distributions.
